# Snake_Game
A classic Snake Game built using Java Swing, featuring smooth movement, score tracking, pause functionality and game-over mechanics.
🎮 Features
✔ Smooth Snake Movement – Uses keyboard controls (↑, ↓, ←, →)
✔ Score System – Increases as the snake eats food
✔ Pause/Resume – Click the pause button or press SPACE to pause/resume  
✔ Game Over Detection – Collision with walls or itself ends the game
✔ Restart Functionality – Press SPACE to restart after losing
✔ Clean UI

🕹️ Controls
- **Arrow Keys**: Change snake direction  
- **SPACE**: Pause/Resume game or restart after game over  
- **Pause Button**: Click to pause/resume (top-right corner)
  
🛠 Technologies Used
Java Swing (GUI)
Java AWT (Event handling, graphics)

📜 How It Works
The snake moves continuously in the current direction.

Eating red food increases its length and score.

Pause the game anytime with SPACE or the pause button  

Hitting walls or itself triggers Game Over.

Press SPACE to restart.
