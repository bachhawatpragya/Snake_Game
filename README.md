# Snake_Game
A classic Snake Game built using Java Swing, featuring smooth movement, score tracking, and game-over mechanics.
🎮 Features
✔ Smooth Snake Movement – Uses keyboard controls (↑, ↓, ←, →)
✔ Score System – Increases as the snake eats food
✔ Game Over Detection – Collision with walls or itself ends the game
✔ Restart Functionality – Press SPACE to restart after losing
✔ Clean UI

🛠 Technologies Used
Java Swing (GUI)
Java AWT (Event handling, graphics)

📜 How It Works
The snake moves continuously in the current direction.

Hitting walls or itself triggers Game Over.

Press SPACE to restart.
